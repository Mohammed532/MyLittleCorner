## About

My Little Corner (MLC) is a side project made to keep note of all of my tasks I needed to do, and all of the lists I needed to keep track of. 

As a college student, I find myself more and more overwhelmed with everything I needed to keep track of. Homework, Assignments, Grocery List. Everything piles on, and I ended up forgetting important deadlines. So, I did as any inspiring engineer would do: I saw a problem, I engineer a solution. Thus, the idea for MLC was born. 

>Note: This is a side project I started, something to continue building my skills and experimenting. This is no means supposed to be a fully fleshed out product, but a means to solve an everyday problems I face, while showcasing my skills and growing them
